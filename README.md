## Overview
BerryScan is a cutting-edge application that integrates cloud of things technology to revolutionize strawberry farming. By utilizing a robotic system equipped with GPS and camera, BerryScan explores your farm, captures images, and sends them to the cloud. Our advanced algorithms then process these images to detect diseases, providing you with detailed insights about the health of your crops and their precise location on your farm.

Key Goals of BerryScan:
- Efficient monitoring and disease detection in strawberry crops.
- Precise GPS-based mapping of disease locations for targeted treatment.
- User-friendly interface to access and interpret farm data.

Achievements:
- Developed a fully functional prototype for automated farm monitoring.
- Implemented robust image processing algorithms for accurate disease detection.
- Integrated GPS technology for precise mapping and location tracking.
